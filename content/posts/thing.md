There's this thing. It is everwhere, all of the time. It is one of a few things that seem all consuming, but *this* thing, it is the worst.

Most people have some version of the thing but no one likes to think or talk about it even though there's all these dumb corporate slogans that tell you it's important to do that. If I'm being more kind and less angry, I think it's because people do not actually understand it and so it's very hard to speak about it and it is less awkward to just pretend like it isn't there.

The accepted wisdom seems to be to just not think about the thing. I've been ruminating over this for sometime, specifically the idea of *just not thinking about it.* 

I was watching the new Mitchell and Webb sketch show the other day and saw this bit about therapists. And the punchline was **exactly this**. How it seems most convenient for society and for the self to just not think about the thing, that is, ideally that would be the solution and we'd be fine. Just think about other things. But it turns out that doesn't work, the thing continues to loom (which also is the point in the bit).

So for now the thing wins. I hope that eventually I'll wear it down.
