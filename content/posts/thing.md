There's this thing. It is everwhere, all of the time. It is one of a few things that seem all consuming, but *this* thing, it is the worst.

Most people have things like this but no one likes to think or talk about this specific thing. If I'm being more kind and less angry, I think it's more that people do not actually understand it.

The accepted wisdom seems to be to just not think about the thing. I've been ruminating over this for sometime, specifically the idea of *just not thinking about it.* 

I was watching the new Mitchell and Webb sketch show the other day and saw this bit about therapists. And the punchline was **exactly this**. How it seems most convenient for society and for the self to just not think about the thing, that is, ideally that would be the solution and we'd be fine. Just think about other things. But it turns out that doesn't work, the thing continues to loom (which also is the point in the bit).

So for now the thing wins, I know eventually I'll wear it down but till then I'll blog about it.
