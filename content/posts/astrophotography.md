This past weekend Geetha, Gobi, and I went camping up in Algonquin with our neighbour (and friend) Jemila. We did part of [this](https://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/visit/camping/highland-backpacking-trail.php) backpacking trail in the backcountry. It was fantastic.

The trail was harder than we expected, it goes into a climb almost immediately and then continues to climb for a bit. Also there was a closure on the path that added a 2.7km detour. This was okay becauase the detour was actually kind of flat :D

We didn't actually plan to do the entire Highlander trail because we haven't done backcountry camping as a group before so this was a bit of a shakedown run. Also, since this was a long weekend, most of the sites were booked and the one we got was the only one we could get; and it was only for Sunday and Monday. So we decided to hike out to our site and then just relax there and do a day trip out to find a good swimming spot.

Setting up camp was great, the swimming was glorious, etc etc. But what I was really excited about was to try to do some astrophotography with my new camera.

What I would ideally have wanted to do would be some of the following:
- Have a dedicated ultrawide lens for the astrophotography
- Figure out the techniques for photostacking which means learn how it works, learn how to use the software, learn how to take the calibration photos, etc
- Figure out what the night sky where we were would actually look like, i.e. be aware of the astral bodies out there and plan a photo accordingly

I didn't do any of the above. I have one lens because the camera was so expensive and that's what I had to use. I also didn't plan for any of the other stuff as much as I should have; I read some blog posts and watched some videos, felt overwhelmed and decided to wing it a little. The good thing was that on one night we had clear skies, and in fact it was only 3 days after a new moon which meant it was also dark.

The pictures on this page were taken between 1030pm and 11pm. I used my Canon EOS R8 with a 50mm Canon RF f/1.8 lens. My f-stop was set to 2.8, ISO was 3200, and shutter speed was 30". And I did borrow my brother's tripod before heading up there so these were taken on that. (And yes, I carried a tripod out to the backcountry). One of the pictures has a streak from a satellite on it and eventually when I figure stuff out, I can take a bunch to stack and just get rid of that. But for now I even like the satellite in there.

The bluish tinge on the first two pictures is because I changed the White Balance setting on the camera to 'Tungsten'. I like how they turned out.
