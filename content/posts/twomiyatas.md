In the mid-2010's my life was lived in small spaces that I filled with bikes, tools, and bike parts. But I wasn't always a person on a bike, it took me some time to get there and then I went all in.

I lived in Toronto and worked in Mississauga, which sucked. Besides the mind-numbing boringness of the Mississauga corporate park with its endless parking lots and dull office buildings, the commute was pretty shitty. For a brief moment I did consider buying a car but besides the commute I really wouldn't have used it that much. I took transit everywhere and if I needed to leave town for whatever, I could rent a car. Moving to Sauga was not even really a consideration. The only real option (I thought at the time) was to start taking transit to work. This was my route:
- Line 1 from Wellesley station to Bloor/Yonge
- Line 2 from Bloor/Yonge to Kipling station OR Islington station if I wanted a beef patty
- A bus from Kipling or Islington to a stop about a kilometre from the office
- Walk to the office unless I was feeling mega shitty, in which case there was a Miway bus that I could take from there

That whole process took about an hour and forty minutes. It was okay, I'd shut my brain off, listen to something and just autopilot my way to work.

A few weeks into this new job I realized that my friend Udai also did pretty much exactly the same commute everyday to his job. He lived in Kensington Market so he started there but he ended up at the same place I did. We began doing the commute together. He'd get out of the train at Bathurst station and I'd meet him there. This was amazing because we could now go to Fahmee bakery and get breakfast there. This was fun for a bit and the morning commute was okay but I think it was the way back that started getting painful. It was just too tiring to end the day with an hour and a half on a couple of buses and the train, often with no sitting room.

We decided that it would be fun and more interesting to bike to work. Udai was kind of into biking at the time and he brought it up first. We talked about it for a bit and then just committed to it. We walked over to Uncle Jacob's on Spadina and bought two Raleigh road bikes for ~$200 each. They were not great bikes but I still remember mine fondly. 

The ride to work was about 25km each way and at the time I remember thinking that was a wild thing to do. The last time I had biked at all was when I was in high school and I never really went anywhere, I just biked around my neighbourhood. But it wasn't that big a deal and we'd bike over in the morning and then coordinate our departure to bike back home together as well. This was our routine for almost a year and a half and it turned into less of a thing we did to commute and more into a way of life.

I wanted to be on my bike all the time. There was a company called Favour that was one of the first delivery app services that came up from the US that contracted people to deliver stuff on their bikes; Exploitation of Labour as a Service! I joined up and started do deliveries after my day job. It was a shitty gig if that was your only gig but for me at the time it was just a way to be biking and doing something after work.

After about a year and a bit of cycling to and from work, Udai and I started talking about  doing bigger rides. In the summer of 2015 we did a ride to Niagara falls with our friend, Guido. Here's us at the end of that.

And this is when we started talking about the big one.

I can't remember who brought it up first, probably Udai. Eventually we were regularly discussing a cross Canada trip, coast to coast, all the provinces. We talked about it as we rode to and from work, over drinks after work, when we were playing football on the weekends - kind of just all the time at that point. I made a spreadsheet that we used to plan this hypothetical trip. I still have it in my Google drive and it makes me smile when I look at it now. Udai and I are pretty different.

At some point we committed. We just said okay, we're doing this. After buying our train tickets to Vancouver (on The Canadian, the Via Rail train that goes all the way), it started feeling real. This was in 2015, and almost 6 months ahead of time, I requested all my measly 2 weeks of vacation for the summer of 2016 as well as an additional 2 months of unpaid leave ðŸ˜…. We were pushing the limits of how much time we could take off at work, unpaid leave included. In fact the majority of our time off was going to be unpaid but we still had a hard limit before we really had to go back to our jobs. 

At this point we had the time off, the train tickets, and the commitment. We needed bikes. I scoured craigslist for weeks. My criteria were:
- Steel frames
- Wide range cassettes or triple crankset. Whatever I could find with the best range for long flat rides as well as long, steep climbs.
- Red and blue. Because those are two of the best colours.

Eventually I found them. Two different sellers, both located in North York. Coincidentally, both sellers were unloading old Miyata touring bikes, one of them red and the other blue. Perfect. We rented a little cargo van went up there with $700 in cash and got 'em both. The red one became mine and his was blue.

The next few weeks we spent all our free time learning how to service these bikes. I replaced my crankset with a new one. The original one was incredibly cool from a bike history perspective, it was a Shimano biopace set; a non-round, ellipse shaped piece of hardware that was supposed to make power transfer more efficient. I hated how it felt. I replaced it with a standard set that just felt more natural to me. We cleaned up the bottom brackets, the bearings in the wheels, replaced brake pads and handlebar tape, and cleaned the hell out of them. They were also slightly small for us, both of them. So we both got extended quill stems and tall seat posts. It was such a great summer of biking and being bike mechanics and drinking beer and just hanging out in the city.

We also spent a LOT of time at MEC scoping out camping equipment. Neither of us had ever camped before and we would be doing it a lot out on the road. We talked to the staff there about our plans, asked them what we may need, did tons of research online, and spent a lot of money ðŸ˜¬

We bought panniers for our bikes (front and back), tents, sleeping bags, mats, a little portable stove, a little pot, water purification tablets, and a whole lot more stuff that we thought we needed for a trip like this. It took months of planning and repeated trips to MEC to build up our stash of equipment for this journey. We rode our bikes a lot to train, the biggest bit being the commute to and from Mississauga, and just got comfortable with the idea of this trip.

this requires a lot of planning before I write it out -_-
