In the mid-2010's my life was lived in small spaces that I filled with bikes, tools, and bike parts. But I wasn't always a person on a bike, it took me some time to get there and then I went all in.

My friend Udai and I both lived in Toronto and worked in Mississauga (at two different companies with offices right by each other). We decided that it would be fun and more interesting to bike to work instead of sit on the TTC (and also Miway) everyday for who knows how long. Buying a car was out of the question because it was too expensive for one but also we were both pretty anti-car. So we decided to do the biking thing. We walked over to Uncle Jacob's on Spadina and bought two Raleigh road bikes for ~$200 each. They were not great bikes but I still remember mine fondly. 

The ride to work was about 25km each way and at the time I remember thinking that was a wild thing to do. The last time I had biked at all was when I was in high school and I never really went anywhere, I just biked around my neighbourhood. But it wasn't that big a deal and we'd bike over in the morning and then coordinate our departure to bike back home together as well. This was our routine for almost a year and a half and it turned into less of a thing we did to commute and more into a way of life.

We started talking about cycling more and more, and doing bigger rides. In the summer of 2015 we did a ride to Niagara falls with our friend, Guido. Here's us at the end of that.

And this is when we started talking about the big one.

I can't remember who brought it up first, probably Udai. Eventually we were regularly discussing a cross Canada trip, coast to coast, all the provinces. We talked about it as we rode to and from work, over drinks after work, when we were playing football on the weekends - kind of just all the time at that point. I made a spreadsheet that we used to plan this hypothetical trip. I still have it in my Google drive and it makes me smile when I look at it now. Udai and I are pretty different.

At some point we committed. We just said okay, we're doing this. After buying our train tickets to Vancouver (on The Canadian, the Via Rail train that goes all the way), it started feeling real. This was in 2015, and almost 6 months ahead of time, I requested all my measly 2 weeks of vacation for the summer of 2016 as well as an additional 2 months of unpaid leave ðŸ˜…. We were pushing the limits of how much time we could take off at work, unpaid leave included. In fact the majority of our time off was going to be unpaid but we still had a hard limit before we really had to go back to our jobs. 

At this point we had the time off, the train tickets, and the commitment. We needed bikes. I scoured craigslist for weeks. My criteria were:
- Steel frames
- Wide range cassettes or triple crankset. Whatever I could find with the best range for long flat rides as well as long, steep climbs.
- Red and blue. Because those are two of the best colours.

Eventually I found them. Two different sellers, both located in North York. Coincidentally, both sellers were unloading old Miyata touring bikes, one of them red and the other blue. Perfect. We rented a little cargo van went up there with $700 in cash and got 'em both. The red one became mine and his was blue.

The next few weeks we spent all our free time learning how to service these bikes. In fact, I replaced my crankset with a new one. The original one was incredibly cool from a bike history perspective, it was a Shimano biopace set; a non-round, ellipse shaped piece of hardware that was supposed to make power transfer more efficient. I hated how it felt. I replaced it with a standard set that just felt more natural to me. We cleaned up the bottom brackets, the bearings in the wheels, replaced brake pads and handlebar tape, and cleaned the hell out of them. They were also slightly small for us, both of them. So we both got extended quill stems and tall seat posts. It was such a great summer of biking and being bike mechanics and drinking beer and just hanging out in the city.

We also spent a LOT of time at MEC scoping out camping equipment. Neither of us had ever camped before and we would be doing it a lot out on the road. We talked to the staff there about our plans, asked them what we may need, did tons of research online, and spent a lot of money ðŸ˜¬
