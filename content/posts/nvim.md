description: "IDE Setup"
---

I've decided to set up Neovim and try it out as my IDE for a bit. It's not that I hate my current setup or anything like that, I've been using [vscodium](https://vscodium.com/) as a vscode replacement for a few months now and it's worked well enough with the extensions I like to use and all that; I've just been thinking about experimenting with Neovim for a bit and I'm finally giving in to the obsession and giving it a shot. 

When I'm working in my VPS or even just locally on my laptop messing around with my OS config I tend to use Vim quite a lot. Part of the reason for this experiment is to build a more comfortable, custom experience for when I am using the editor locally. I'm also looking to get better with Vim in general, I can get around but I know I'm not being as efficient as you can be with the tool. If I use it more often, I think I'll get better at using it. I cannot deny though, that a big component of the motivation for this whole project is the curiosity around Neovim and the extremely cool aesthetic of a fully custom Neovim IDE. I like learning new things and this is the thing I'm teaching myself now. 

This post is a way to document how I'm building my config and will likely be updated as I continue to tinker with the whole setup.


## Installing neovim

```zsh {linenos=inline style=nvim}
sudo dnf install neovim
```

```javascript {linenos=inline}
const test = () => {
    console.log('wow');
}
```
