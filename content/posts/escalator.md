I love this rant. In this video, Krist Novoselic goes off on escalators. Specifically the way that people use them. Watch it. 

{{< video src="escalators.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="auto" >}}

In case you didn't actually watch, his rant is about how escalators were designed like stairs because they're meant to be used like them. They just make us faster at going up stairs. Krist Novoselic is frustrated by people standing on escalators. 

Things that I love about the video:

- How stoned he is.
- How Kurt and Dave immediately groan as he begins the rant. This is obviously a recurring theme.
- Kurt butts in with a solution. Stand to the side so that people can walk up the left. Krist ignores him and continues the rant.

I found this on YouTube years ago, I watched it, and then forgot about it. The stupid AI bullshit in the air these days reminded me of this video.

### Excuse me, whatever the fuck do you mean?

What I mean is that so called "AI" is the Escalator. I'm just going to ignore the fact that what is referred to as a monolithic AI is actually a myriad set of technologies. LLM's have taken over the concept and when people say AI now they kind of just mean one of these LLM's. Whatever, I'm just going to say AI and you, the reader, can substitute whatever you want in there, it doesn't matter.

What matters is the idea. AI is supposed to make us better and quicker but people are standing on the escalator. Instead of being better and quicker, we're feeding things into the machine and regurgitating what it tells us.

**I'm sure there are people that are like "oh man _I_ don't use it that way, I have a workflow that blah blah blah blah." Great, neat. I'm not talking about you.**

I'm talking about:
- The people inundating YouTube with generated music playlists
- The people wasting everyone's time with generated emails
- The 'grok, is this true?' morons on twitter
- Other similar people doing similarly idiotic things

People don't care about being better, they just care about quicker. In fact, quicker and shittier is fine. 

Krist's rant sounds almost prophetic to me, like he was possessed by someone from the future. You want to stand on the escalator? Fine, just move to the side please (i.e. stand to the right and please just leave me/us alone). Which leads me to the next point.

### The "AI is inevitable" bullshit

There's a lot of this going around right now. Posts where people try to convince you that "AI is here now and you need to adapt" are basically the main genre of things being uploaded to LinkedIn. "AI won't take your job, a person using AI will."

Shut. The. Fuck. Up.

None of this is inevitable. Megacorps (run by loser finance guys posing as scientists) have been given the keys to our societies and are engaging in wildly unethical, unsustainable extractivism. These posts about inevitability and people having to adapt are just attempts to manufacture consent. We don't have to accept anything or adapt to anything if we don't want to. If it's wrong.

And sure, call me a Luddite. I don't mind. In fact I consider it a badge of honour.

### Everything is business, nothing is interesting

I actually happen to think this stuff _is_ interesting. LLM's are cool. Computer Vision is cool. Machine Learning is cool. But the CEO's, VP's of Sales, Heads of Marketing, etc are hell-bent on pushing this shit on us as a foRcE mULtIpLIeR.

There _are_ great applications for these kinds of technologies. [Here's](https://tehiku.nz/te-hiku-tech/papa-reo/) an incredible example. The indigenous Māori language, te reo Māori, is dying. The goal of 'te hiku media' is to collect all the recorded te reo Māori that they can find and build a model for the language. They are currently able to translate between te reo Māori and English with 82% accuracy.

All of this was done _with_ the Māori peoples' consent and participation. They used **two** GPU's to get the model trained. And the tool has been built to do something specific. When these tools use data that makes sense for a specific job, not only can they produce amazing results, but they can be trained to do so without chugging fresh water, producing noise pollution, emanating waves of heat, and crashing global supply chains because of chip hoarding. Te Hiku Media exists in opposition to the fucking Silicon Valley ethos which seems to involve taking whatever they want from whomever they want without asking for permission. 

And the problems they claim they are trying to solve are...¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Listening to these weirdos talk about it is crazy. Apparently it doesn't make sense to focus on climate change because it's too hard, we should just create a digital god to solve the problem for us. 

Wut?

Oh and the god is hungry. The god needs to eat tens of thousands of GPU's to generate images cobbled together from art made by real people so that LinkedIn losers can write a post about #marketing.

### It gets worse

Just the fact that we are watching a handful of people burn the atmosphere for social media clicks is dire enough, but it _does_ actually get worse than that.

[So called "AI" is being used to murder people in an ongoing genocide](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/4/ai-assisted-genocide-israel-reportedly-used-database-for-gaza-kill-lists).

If you're one of those people that thinks posting Al Jazeera makes me a woke radical or whatever then [here's another source, actually the original source](
https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/). Though I know that if you think Al Jazeera is woke then +972 will be as well for you.

We've known for a long time that the megacorps have been collecting all our data. Sometimes with our consent and often without. Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook/Meta, Twitter, Apple, Amazon, etc; they're all constantly sucking up whatever they can from us under the protection of the commercial relationships we have signed up for under them. [But they're doing worse things than just that bullshit](https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/). Microsoft has been storing surveillance data on their cloud. This is the data collected from a people living under occupation.

Similarly Google has 'Project Nimbus', which provides cloud storage and compute to the IOF. I wonder what they use it for? Surely just to store HR/payroll documents.

And then there's the next level of evil tech assholes. Personally I think that the New York Times is a neo-liberal rag but [here's something that they wrote that should be read](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html). Peter Thiel backed Palantir is building a domestic panopticon, the elusive surveillance state that the Republicans have been trying to create since the early 2000's.

This is scary, fucked up shit. And it is directly related to the stupid fucking studio Ghibli stealing image generator machines. These are the same thing, they come from the same place, from the same minds, from the same venture capital money.

**Krist Novoselic tried to warn us.**

### Recommended brain reset tools

- [Empire of AI](https://karendhao.com/). Brilliant. The first time I heard the story about Te Hiku Media was actually on the podcast, Tech Won't Save Us (Paris Marx), but reading about it again in Empire of AI recently made me think about how this stuff can be wonderful. And how like many technologies, it is being co-opted by lunatics.

- [Tech Won't Save Us](https://www.techwontsave.us/). My favourite podcast. Always fantastic guests, and always great conversation about what is happening. It's not an "oh shit things are hopeless" vibe either. It's always presenting a hopeful vision.

- [DAIR](https://www.dair-institute.org/). Timnit Gebru was fired from Google for doing her job well. i.e. researching the ethical implications of AI (specifically for co-authoring [this](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) paper on LLM's). She is one of the great researchers that went on to found DAIR, an independent institute that explores a better vision for technology.

- [Where's Your Ed At](https://www.wheresyoured.at/). Ed Zitron's very funny blog. His piece on [business idiots](https://www.wheresyoured.at/) is just fantastic.

- [Nik Suresh](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/?ref=wheresyoured.at). I've linked to a specific post that killed me the first time I read it, but Nikhil's blog is amazing in general.
