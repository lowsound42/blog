description: "This bread sucks."

I do a lot of things that are ultimately meaningless but make me feel good. One of these things is getting good bread instead of the supermarket stuff. This means getting bread from bakeries and cafes near us instead of the Dempsters and Villagio. However, due to the convergence of a series of procrastinations I found that we were at home this week with no bread available. Reluctantly, I walked over to the No Frills to get something to tide us over and I brought home this bag of Dimpflmeier.

Now I'll say that I have never had a Dimpflmeier bread before, maybe they do some amazing rye bread or something. This bread is bad though. I hated it and I'm here to help you make a better decision than I did.

I ate a slice this morning and I felt like I was eating melty plastic that somehow had the texture of bread. It could only be the universe  punishing me for failing my mission to patronize our local bakeries. Forgive me universe, I have learned my lesson. I want to pass my message along to everybody else out there: Stay away from Dimpflmeier Farmers' Gold bread. If you want to eat something bad though this is the thing you should eat.
