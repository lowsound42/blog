I've built this website so many times. 

Once upon a time it was all hand coded HTML, CSS, and JS. As I built that out, I essentially built out my own little framework to get things done effectively. That was fun but also pretty inefficient (and tedious) after a while.

Then it became an over-engineered Next/React SSR thing because I kind of just wanted to try out the hot new thing. Personally, I enjoyed very little about brushing up on React after a while of not having used it at all.

More recently I've been playing around with Go and htmx on the side so I figured maybe that would be a cool thing to do. And it kind of was. But again, so much unnecessary work to do...what exactly? 

Did I really need to set up a database to store my posts? Oh and also authentication so I could login as a site admin and create a new post? I kind of went down that road for a bit and it was fun but again overkill for what I *actually* wanted to do.

And that's what it's come down to. What do I want from this? If I think about why I'm looking to put this up here at all, it's pretty simple. I want to write about things and I want this website to be a place for the things I write. That's it. So all of the stuff I've tried has been fun, but going down these paths has complicated the process and really detracted from the whole point of having this space. I've learned a lot but I've written nothing because I was always using what I was learning about to plan a rebuild of the page.

I've now decided to just go with Hugo (kind of the obvious choice for a personal blog in retrospect). The hardest decision to make was what theme to use. Now I just have to start writing.

Here goes.
