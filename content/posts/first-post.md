I've built this website so many times. Once upon a time it was all hand coded HTML, CSS, and JS. As I built that out, I essentially built out my own little framework to get things done effectively. That was fun, but also so inefficient after a while.

Then it became an over-engineered Next/React SSR thing. I kind of just wanted to try it out with server actions and all that. Not a super enjoyable experience.

More recently, I've been playing around with Go and htmx on the side so I figured maybe that would be a cool thing to do. And it kind of was. But again, so much work and infrastructure to do...what exactly?

And that's what it's come down to? What do I want from this? If I think about why I'm looking to put this up here at all, it's a pretty simple thing. I want to write things and I want them to be on the internet. That's basically it. So all of the stuff I tried is fun, but it can complicate the process. What actually ended up happening is that I've learned a lot but I've written nothing. Not a loss by any means but not what I wanted to do here.

I'm now using Hugo (kind of the obvious choice for a personal blog in retrospect). The hardest decision to make was what theme to use. Now I get to write stuff!

Here goes.
