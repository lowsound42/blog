There's a lot in this world that makes me mad. When something like this is actively on my mind I'll try to add it to this list instead of letting it occupy my thoughts. Maybe this will be helpful. Some of these things are probably bigger than others.

### July 12, 2025

- The religious zealotry around whatever the contemporary hotness coming out of silicon valley is. There is almost no critical thought around what, why, how, and for whom, and a lot of fawning over "growth", "value", and other such metrics.
- People that fight to "preserve the character of their neighbourhoods." This is almost always NIMBYs fighting to keep other people out of a home and to deny efficient, equitable transit to those that rely on it. Usually this is for the sake of their "property values" but can sometimes be for even stupider reasons like not wanting to lose a parking spot.
- Food delivery apps that claim to be innovative when their actual accomplishments include:
  - Cannibalizing our municipal infrastructure for their own use without contributing to upkeep in any meaningful way
  - Turning the employment relationship on its head and exploiting people as a result
  - Delivering an inferior version of good food for the low price of ${extremelyExpensive}.
- People that walk really slowly on the sidewalk while also blocking the way for everyone behind them. Take your time but please let me get by.

- People that like living in unwalkable, pedestrian hostile, boring suburbs acting like they should have not just a say in the urban planning and development of my city, but the final word. Our own authoritarian provincial leader kowtowing to this selfish cohort so that he can keep power like the No Name dictator that he is makes this beyond infuriating.

- This recent push to return to the office for PrOdUcTivITy. No research to back it up, no explanation besides "it is better", "duh watercooler chats", etc. Our cities are less congested now, people have better lives now, our salaries mean more now. But sure, change it all for the vibes you goddamn ghouls.
