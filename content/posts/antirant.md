After hearing about my rant post, Geetha suggested I do one for things that delight me. I think it's a good idea, there are a lot of things that make me happy and it'll be nice to jot them down over time.

- The way Gobi (my dog) sighs and burrows her head into the bed as she makes herself comfortable, ready to nap.
- Software that is built by people for other people and not for "customers." Things like [jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin), [mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes), and [freshRSS](https://github.com/FreshRSS).
- Community building. This is kind of wishy-washy but it means something different to everyone. I know it when I see it and I love it. The neighbourhood I live in always has something happening, especially in the summer. Also my neighbours are lovely in general and it really feels like people care about each other. [This](https://showuptoronto.ca/) is a great resource for more concrete examples of real things happening in Toronto.
- Cycling. It feels like freedom.

- PROPAGANDHI!!!!! Best. Canadian. Band. Ever. They have dethroned Rush (for me) and my biggest regret is getting into them so late. There are so many things that I love about them:
  - Their politics are proggressive, inclusive, radical, and energizing. Especially today when everything seems so milquetoast and subsumed by corporate enshittification.
  - They have evolved with every album and even though I do like that old 90's punk sound, I love the thrashy metal sound they've grown into. That's actually more my speed.
  - The songs aren't conventional at all. They're not verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse or whatever. They're full of time changes, poetic streams of consciousness, and stank-face riffage.
  - They are just fucking awesome.
