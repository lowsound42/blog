After hearing about my rant post, Geetha suggested I do one for things that delight me. I think it's a good idea, there are a lot of things that make me happy and it'll be nice to jot them down over time.

- The way Gobi (my dog) sighs and burrows her head into the bed as she makes herself comfortable, ready to nap.
- Software that is built by people for other people and not for "customers." Things like [jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin), [mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes), and [freshRSS](https://github.com/FreshRSS).
- Community building. This is kind of wishy-washy but it means something different to everyone. I know it when I see it and I love it. The neighbourhood I live in always has something happening, especially in the summer. Also my neighbours are lovely in general and it really feels like people care about each other. [This](https://showuptoronto.ca/) is a great resource for more concrete examples of real things happening in Toronto.
- Cycling. It feels like freedom.
