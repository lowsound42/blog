So I'm learning (relearning?) some basic maths. (I grew up saying _Maths_ and not _Math_ and I'm just going to keep saying it that way). It's fun and it's also a way to get better at using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. What's going to be really cool is using LateX to write about what I'm learning. 

Getting it set up on this Hugo theme that I'm using was a breeze thanks to [this](https://behova.net/posts/hugo-setup/) excellent blog post. Below are some examples of the nice formatting this allows us to do.

Example of an inline \(a^*=x-b^*\) equation.

Examples of block equations:

\[a^{(\frac{3}{2})}=x-b^8\]

\[
3 \times a = 23 - a
\]

\[
a^3 + (\frac{x}{y})
\]
